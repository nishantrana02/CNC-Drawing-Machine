# CNC Drawing Machine  

## Overview  
This project showcases a **CNC drawing machine** built using **Arduino Nano, stepper motors, and salvaged printer parts**. The machine precisely draws designs based on programmed inputs.  

## Unique Concept  
This project follows the **"KABAD SE JUGAD"** approach, where components from **old printers and circuit boards** were repurposed to build the machine.  

## Components Used  
- **Stepper Motors** (from old printers)  
- **Linear Axes** (scavenged from old printers)  
- **Breadboard Wires**  
- **Arduino Nano**  
- **ULN2003 Motor Drivers**  
- **SG90 Servo Motor**  
- **Wood Pieces** (for frame construction)  
- **Various Hardware Tools**  

## Assembly Process  
1. **Sourcing Components:** Gathered parts from **junkyards, old printers, and electronic stores**.  
2. **Machine Assembly:** Constructed the **CNC frame and mechanical structure**.  
3. **Calibration & Precision Adjustments:** Ensured **accurate movement** and **precise drawings**.  
4. **Programming & Testing:** Loaded **G-code instructions** to control the **drawing patterns**.  

## Challenges Faced  
 **Multiple Failed Attempts:** Took **six iterations** to achieve a working model.  
 **Alignment Issues:** Required **fine-tuning for accuracy**.  
 **Component Sourcing:** Had to salvage **usable parts from old devices**.  

## Conclusion  
This **CNC drawing machine project** was a **great learning experience**, emphasizing **persistence, patience, and problem-solving**. It demonstrates how **electronics, mechanics, and programming** can be combined to create a **functional DIY CNC machine**.
